# Tech Blog

  ## Description
  I created this application in hopes of providing a central location for any tech related posts. This allows a user to make posts and comments while also being able to delete/edit them. One of the challenges I faced was getting new information in my post to appear after a user is finished editing. I was at least able to edit the title though.
